# Sample PDB Files

These files are retrieved from [RSCB's FTP server](https://www.rcsb.org/pages/download/ftp) using the method described in [my blog post](https://tianyishi2001.github.io/ox/bioinformatics/download-and-sync-with-the-entire-pdb-database.html). Here are some features of the selected PDB files stored in this directory:


- 1a8o: a simple X-Ray structure
- 4f7i: Lots of sheets
- 7znf: solution NMR; lots of models
- 3l1p: complex with DNA
